## Deployment Steps on Streamlit Cloud

2. Log in to Streamlit Cloud:
   - Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

3. Deploy the application:
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository
   - Main file path: `simple_app.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

4. Share the application:
   - Copy the URL provided by Streamlit Cloud
   - Include it in your presentation materials
   - Test it once deployed to ensure everything works

## Post-Deployment

- Test the application by uploading the sample data files
- Verify all visualizations and analyses work correctly
- Ensure the TDA insights are generating as expected

## Backup Plan

If you encounter any issues with Streamlit Cloud, you can:
1. Run the application locally during your presentation
2. Use screenshots of the app in your presentation
3. Focus on the TDA concepts and insights rather than the live demo
